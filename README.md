# 🎮 Guess the Number – Python Game

This project was developed as part of the Python Programming module in the MSc in Data Science, Big Data & Business Analytics (UCM). It is an interactive console game where the player must guess a secret number between 1 and 1000, with options to play solo or against another player.

## 🧠 What I learned and applied in this project

- Use of control structures (`if`, `while`, `for`)
- Creation of interactive menus and user input validation
- Random number generation with `random`
- Game logic for different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
- Writing and reading Excel files using `openpyxl` to track statistics
- Modular code with separated functions
- Improved user experience with clear and dynamic messages

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal was to apply Python programming skills to develop a complete, functional, and extendable game. An additional challenge was to implement data logging and statistics tracking for individual players.
